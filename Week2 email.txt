Dear John,

Hope this email finds you well.  

I am pleased to inform you that we have designed a prototype of your website for your review. 

Kindly go through them and let us know what changes you would like us to include as well as edits you would want us to make on these prototypes.

We would move on with the next stage of development as soon as your feedback has been received.

Thank you.

Your sincerely,
Development team
