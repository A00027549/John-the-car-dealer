Dear Client,

Hope this email finds you well.  

I am pleased to inform you that we have designed a prototype of your website for your review. 

Kindly go through them and let us know what changes you would like us to include, as well as edits you would want us to make on these prototypes.
Some of the features on the website include; A preview of the OMSP of the vehicle, a clean and easy to read website and an idea for your new logo.

We would move on with the next stage of development as soon as your feedback has been received. Please inspect the website carefully and feel free to make any comments 
or suggestions as it is your website at the end of the day :)

Thank you.

Your sincerely,
Development team
