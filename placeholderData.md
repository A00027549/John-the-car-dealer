About John

Welcome to My Car Showcase

Hi, I’m John—a lifelong car enthusiast. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been captivated by how cars are engineered, from the roar of the engine to the elegance of the design. What started as childhood curiosity has grown into a passion, and this site is my way of sharing that journey. Here, you’ll find the cars I’ve collected, restored, and raced, each with its own story and place in my heart.

My Collection

Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to own cars that span decades and styles—from timeless classics to modern performance icons:
1967 Ford Mustang Fastback – Fully restored with original parts and a custom engine, a perfect blend of power and nostalgia.
2020 Porsche 911 Turbo S – Modern engineering at its finest, delivering unmatched performance and style.
1988 Audi Quattro – A rally legend, lovingly preserved and one of my earliest deep-dive restorations.

Restoration Stories

Restoring a car isn’t just repair—it’s bringing history back to life. Many of my cars arrived in rough shape, but with patience and care, they’ve been reborn. On this site, I share before-and-after photos, the techniques I used, and the challenges I faced along the way.

Racing Adventures

For me, owning cars isn’t enough—I have to drive them. I’ve raced in classic rallies and modern track events, chasing the thrill of speed and precision. Here, you’ll find race highlights, prep insights, and advice for anyone curious about motorsports.

Car Culture

Cars are more than machines—they’re a community. Through shows, forums, and meetups, I’ve connected with fellow enthusiasts who share this passion. This site is a space to celebrate that culture, exchange knowledge, and build lasting connections.
