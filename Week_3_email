Dear John O'Reily,
We hope this email finds you well, we are emailing to inform you on our decesions about certain aspects of the website. 
We understand as per your request that you would like for the webpage to cater for colour blind individuals like yourself.
We have adhered to this request by implementing certain design elements to the website. For example, the simple black and white 
contrast of the background and the text allows for colour blind users to have just as much readablility as non-colour blind users+.
The website also avoid colours like red-green and blue-yellow, as these colours often make it dificult for colour blind individuals to differentiate.
The website also follow the WCAG guidlines for accesibility, for example we follow their contrast ratio, as they recomend it for 
allowing a universal user experience. We implemented alt test for the images on the website, this allows for users using a screen reader to have
a much better user experience as the alt text is read out. This may also prove usefull for users that are colour blind as some of the images
may be hard for them to decipher.

Kind Regards,
The Development Team.
